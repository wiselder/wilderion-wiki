# Geophilic

**Geophilic** is a datapack that improves vanilla world generation, making landscapes more picturesque and diverse.

---

## 🌍 What Is It?

Geophilic is a datapack that slightly modifies Minecraft's world generation to "refresh" it. Playing with it, you'll notice all the same familiar biomes and landscapes, but in a more perfected and beautiful form.

**Features:**
- 🏔️ More natural biome transitions
- 🌲 Improved vegetation and detail
- 🌊 Beautiful coastlines
- ⛰️ More realistic terrain

## 🎮 How It Works

The datapack works server-side — you don't need to install anything. All generation changes are automatically applied to new chunks.

:::info Important
Generation changes only affect **new** territories. Already generated chunks remain unchanged.

## 🌐 Where It Works

:::info
Geophilic is only used on the **Overnight** server.
:::

Other servers use standard vanilla generation.
