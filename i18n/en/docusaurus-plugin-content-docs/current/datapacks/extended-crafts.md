# Extended Crafts

This datapack adds many useful recipes for player convenience: block dyeing, uncrafting, and light block crafting.

---

## 🎨 Block Dyeing

Recolor already dyed blocks to another color without having to craft them again!

### How It Works

Surround **8 dyed blocks** with the desired **dye** in the center:

```
[Block] [Block] [Block]
[Block] [Dye]   [Block]
[Block] [Block] [Block]
```

**Result:** 8 blocks of the new color

### Supported Blocks

| Block Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Glass** | Any stained glass → another color |
| **Glass Panes** | Any stained panes → another color |
| **Terracotta** | Any stained terracotta → another color |
| **Candles** | Any colored candles → another color |

:::tip Tip
This is especially useful when you've accumulated many blocks of one color but need another!
