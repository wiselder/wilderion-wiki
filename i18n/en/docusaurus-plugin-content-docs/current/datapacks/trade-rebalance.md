# Trade Rebalance

**Trade Rebalance** is an official Mojang datapack that overhauls the villager trading system, making it more balanced and interesting.

---

## 🎯 Why Is This Needed?

In vanilla Minecraft, villager trading has several issues:
- You can get almost any enchanted book from a single librarian
- Some professions are nearly useless
- Easy to get the best gear without exploring the world

Trade Rebalance solves these problems by making trading more diverse and encouraging exploration.

## 📚 Librarian Changes

The most important change concerns **librarians**:

### Biome Determines Enchantments

Librarians now sell **different enchantments depending on the biome** where the village is located:

| Biome | Available Enchantments |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Desert** | Fire Protection, Blast Protection, Curse of Binding |
| **Jungle** | Knockback, Swift Sneak, Punch |
| **Plains** | Protection, Efficiency, Unbreaking |
| **Savanna** | Sharpness, Looting, Impaling |
| **Snowy** | Silk Touch, Fire Aspect, Frost Walker |
| **Swamp** | Mending, Respiration, Aqua Affinity |
| **Taiga** | Fortune, Quick Charge, Power |

:::tip Tip
To get all the enchantments you need, you'll have to find villages in different biomes or move villagers!
:::

### Enchantment Levels

- **Level 1 enchantments** — available immediately
- **Maximum level** — only at Master level (profession level 5)

## 🗺️ Cartographer Changes

**Cartographers** now sell maps to various structures depending on the biome:

| Biome | Structure Maps |
|-------|----------------|
| **Desert** | Pyramid, Jungle Temple |
| **Jungle** | Jungle Temple |
| **Plains** | Trial Chamber |
| **Savanna** | Village |
| **Snowy** | Igloo |
| **Swamp** | Witch Hut |
| **Taiga** | Pillager Outpost |

## ⚔️ Weaponsmith & Armorer Changes

### Weaponsmiths

Now sell **random enchanted diamond tools**:
- Diamond pickaxe with enchantment
- Diamond axe with enchantment

Enchantments are random and not always maximum level.

### Armorers

Sell **random enchanted diamond armor**:
- Armor pieces can have various enchantments

This makes searching for perfect gear through trading less predictable and more interesting.

3. **More diversity** — different professions became more useful
4. **Progression** — better offers at higher levels
