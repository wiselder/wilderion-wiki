# Quick Start

:::info
A quick start guide with answers to the most popular questions.
:::

## How to Start Playing?

1. Launch Minecraft with a licensed account
2. Add server: `overnight.wilderion.ru` (or another from the [list](/))
3. Connect and write in chat!

### How to Enable Survival Mode?

On first join, you'll be in **Adventure** mode. This is protection from newbie griefing that protects old players during your trial period.

Write in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/S4DGsremCC) or [Telegram](https://t.me/wilderion_project) chat asking for access, and we'll grant you permission to play. **Make sure you're on the server at that moment!**

:::tip Automatic Promotion
You'll automatically get full access after **12 hours** of playtime on the server (trial period).

## I Can't Use Flint and Steel / Open Others' Chests!

This is normal! This measure was taken to protect from newbie griefing and protects old players during your trial period.

**What you CAN do:**
- ✅ Place and use **your own** chests
- ✅ Ask other players to light a portal for you
- ✅ Use public containers at spawn

**You'll get full access:**
- After **12 hours** of real playtime (trial period)
- Or by admin decision
