# Restrictions (Hammer)

The server may use a **restriction system** (Hammer plugin). Staff can apply restrictions to players: for example, forbid using certain tools, breaking or placing certain blocks, or eating certain food.

If you have restrictions, you will see a chat message when you try to do something that is not allowed — the action will be cancelled.

## What can be restricted

| Type | What it means for you |
|------|------------------------|
| **Mining (MINE)** | You cannot use listed tools (pickaxe, axe, shovel, etc.) to break blocks |
| **Breaking (BREAK)** | You cannot break listed blocks (e.g. ores, obsidian) |
| **Placing (PLACE)** | You cannot place listed blocks (e.g. TNT) |
| **Food/drinks (CONSUME)** | You cannot eat or drink listed items |

Restrictions can apply to all worlds or only to a specific one (e.g. only in the Nether).

## Presets

Staff can give you a **preset** — a ready set of restrictions (e.g. “no expensive tools” or “food limits”). To see what a preset does, ask staff or check the preset list if you have access to the commands.

## If something doesn’t work

- If you see a message that an action is not allowed, a restriction is in effect for you under server rules or staff decision.
- If you think a restriction was applied by mistake or you want to change it — contact server staff.

Staff manage restrictions with `/restrict` commands (giving/removing presets, viewing the list).
