## 💡 Usage Tips

### Interior Lighting

Place light blocks in ceiling corners for even lighting without visible sources.

### Mob Protection

Place light blocks on roofs and in dark places — mobs won't spawn, and lighting stays invisible.

### Decorative Lighting

Use low brightness blocks (1-5) to create atmospheric lighting in basements, caves and mysterious places.

### Path Lighting

Place light blocks under translucent blocks (glass, ice) to create glowing paths.
