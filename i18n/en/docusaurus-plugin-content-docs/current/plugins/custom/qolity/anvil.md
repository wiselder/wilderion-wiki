### How it Works

In vanilla Minecraft, renaming an item on the anvil can cost many levels, especially for enchanted items. On our servers:

| Action | Vanilla | On Wilderion |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Renaming regular item | 1+ levels | **1 level** |
| Renaming enchanted | 5-39 levels | **1 level** |
| Renaming after repair | Accumulates | **1 level** |

## ✅ Conditions

The improvement works **only for pure renaming**:

- ✅ First slot occupied with item
- ✅ Second slot **empty**
- ✅ New name entered

:::warning Doesn't affect
