# Elytra Restriction

The addon restricts elytra usage for new players.

---

## ⏰ How it Works?

New players cannot use elytra for the first **48 hours** of real time.

### Why?

- ⚖️ **Balance** — elytra give huge mobility advantage
- 🗺️ **Exploration** — newcomers should explore the world on foot
- 🤝 **Socialization** — more chances to meet other players
- 🛡️ **Protection** — preventing quick griefing and escape

## 📊 Restriction Status

### How to Check Remaining Time?

## ✅ After Restriction Removal

After 48 hours of real time:

## 💡 Tips for Newcomers

### While Waiting for Unlock:

1. **Explore on foot** — you'll find lots of interesting things
2. **Build base** — settle in before gaining mobility
3. **Gather resources** — fireworks for flight aren't free
4. **Make friends** — socialize with other players

### Preparing for Flight:

- 🎆 Accumulate gunpowder for fireworks
- 🔧 Find materials to repair elytra (phantom membranes)
- 📍 Remember important locations for future flights
