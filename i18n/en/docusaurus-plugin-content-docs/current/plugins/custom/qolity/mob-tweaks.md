# Mob Tweaks

Addons change the behavior of some mobs for more comfortable gameplay.

## 👻 Phantoms

### Problem in Vanilla
Phantoms attack players who haven't slept for more than 3 game days. This is annoying during building and exploration.

### Our Solution

:::tip Change
Phantoms **don't attack first**. They will only attack if you hit them first!
:::

**How it works:**
- Phantoms still spawn when you haven't slept
- They fly around but don't attack
- If you hit a phantom — it will start attacking back
- After phantom's death others won't retaliate

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Can build peacefully at night
- ✅ Phantoms don't distract from tasks
- ✅ Membranes can still be farmed (just hit first)
- ✅ No need to constantly sleep

## 🟣 Endermen

### Problem in Vanilla
Endermen can pick up and place blocks, leading to destruction of builds and landscape.

### Our Solution

:::tip Change
Enderman griefing chance is **significantly reduced**.
:::

**How it works:**
- Endermen rarely pick up blocks
- Your builds are safer
- Landscape doesn't turn into chaos
- Endermen can still teleport and attack

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Builds don't get destroyed
- ✅ Landscape stays beautiful
- ✅ Fewer random holes in ground
- ✅ Ender pearls can still be farmed

<summary>**Phantoms aren't dangerous at all?**</summary>

They're dangerous if you attack them first. Just ignore them and they won't touch you.

<summary>**Endermen don't pick blocks at all?**</summary>

They do, but very rarely. Chance is significantly reduced but not removed completely.
