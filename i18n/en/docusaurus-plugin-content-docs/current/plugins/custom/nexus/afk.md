## 💤 What is AFK?

**AFK** (Away From Keyboard) is a status showing that a player is temporarily absent. This helps other players understand why you're not responding in chat.

## ⚙️ How it Works

### Manual Activation

Type `/afk` to manually enter AFK mode:
- A message about your status will appear in chat
- Your nickname may display with **AFK** tag

### Automatic Activation

On some servers AFK activates automatically if you don't move for a certain time.

### Exiting AFK

AFK mode automatically turns off when you:
- Move
- Write in chat
- Interact with the world
- Re-enter `/afk`

Upon exiting AFK you'll see a message with the time spent in absence mode.
