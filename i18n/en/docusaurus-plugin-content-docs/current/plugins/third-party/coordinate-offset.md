# CoordinateOffset

**CoordinateOffset** is a plugin that hides or offsets coordinates in the F3 menu.

---

## 🧭 What is it?

On the **Twilight** server this plugin is used to create a more hardcore gaming experience:

- ❌ **Coordinates hidden** — F3 doesn't show real coordinates
- 🗺️ **Navigation by landmarks** — use stars, sun and landscape
- 🧠 **Path memorization** — build trails and place markers

---

## 🎮 Where it Works

:::info Twilight Only
CoordinateOffset only works on the **Twilight** server, where it's part of the hardcore survival concept.
:::

On other servers coordinates work normally.

## 💡 Navigation Without Coordinates

### Orientation by Sky

| Landmark | Direction |
|----------|-------------|
| ☀️ **Sun rises** | East |
| ☀️ **Sun sets** | West |
| 🌙 **Moon rises** | East |
| ⭐ **Stars rotate** | Around north |

### Creating Landmarks

- 🗼 **Towers** — build tall towers for navigation
- 🔥 **Campfires** — smoke is visible from afar
- 🪧 **Signs** — mark directions
- 🛤️ **Trails** — pave roads

### Maps

Craft maps! They work and show your position relative to the drawn territory.

## 🎯 Why This is Needed

Hiding coordinates brings back that magic from the first days in Minecraft:

- 🌟 **Exploration** — world seems huge and unknown again
- 🏠 **Value of home** — your base becomes truly important
- 🤝 **Cooperation** — help each other find the way
- 📖 **Stories** — "remember when we got lost in that forest?"
