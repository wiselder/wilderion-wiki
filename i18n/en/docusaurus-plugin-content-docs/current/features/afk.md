# AFK System

Wilderion servers have an AFK (Away From Keyboard) system that shows when a player is away from their computer.

---

## 💤 What is AFK?

**AFK** (Away From Keyboard) — a status showing that a player is temporarily away. This helps other players understand why you're not responding in chat.

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/afk` | Toggle AFK mode on/off |

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Manual Activation

Type `/afk` to manually enter AFK mode:
- A message will appear in chat about your status
- Your name may display with an **AFK** tag

### Automatic Activation

On some servers, AFK activates automatically if you don't move for a certain time.

### Exiting AFK

AFK mode automatically deactivates when you:
- Move
- Write in chat
- Interact with the world
- Type `/afk` again

When exiting AFK, you'll see a message showing how long you were away.
