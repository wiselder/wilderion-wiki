## 💰 Cheap Renaming

### How It Works

In vanilla Minecraft, renaming an item on an anvil can cost many levels, especially for enchanted items. On our servers:

| Action | Vanilla | On Wilderion |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Renaming a regular item | 1+ levels | **1 level** |
| Renaming an enchanted item | 5-39 levels | **1 level** |
| Renaming after repair | Accumulates | **1 level** |

## ✅ Conditions

The improvement works **only for pure renaming**:

- ✅ First slot contains an item
- ✅ Second slot is **empty**
- ✅ A new name is entered

:::warning Does Not Affect
