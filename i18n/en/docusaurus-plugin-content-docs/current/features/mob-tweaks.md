# Mob Changes

On Wilderion servers, some mobs have modified behavior for a more comfortable gaming experience.

---

## 👻 Phantoms

### The Vanilla Problem
Phantoms attack players who haven't slept for more than 3 in-game days. This is annoying when building and exploring.

### Our Solution

:::tip Change
Phantoms **don't attack first**. They will only attack if you hit them first!
:::

**How it works:**
- Phantoms still spawn when you don't sleep
- They fly around but don't attack
- If you hit a phantom — it will attack back
- After a phantom dies, others won't seek revenge

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Build peacefully at night
- ✅ Phantoms don't distract you
- ✅ Membranes can still be farmed (just hit first)
- ✅ No need to constantly sleep

## 🟣 Endermen

### The Vanilla Problem
Endermen can pick up and place blocks, leading to destruction of builds and landscape.

### Our Solution

:::tip Change
Enderman griefing chance is **significantly reduced**.
:::

**How it works:**
- Endermen rarely pick up blocks
- Your builds are safer
- Landscape doesn't turn into chaos
- Endermen can still teleport and attack

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Builds don't get destroyed
- ✅ Landscape stays beautiful
- ✅ Fewer random holes in the ground
- ✅ Ender pearls can still be farmed
