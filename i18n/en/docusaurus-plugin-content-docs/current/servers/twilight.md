**Twilight** is a server for true ascetics. For those who want to achieve goals using their own strength and ingenuity, in the spirit of cozy survival, when modern plugins and mods didn't exist yet!

## ⚔️ Features

### World Without Borders and Coordinates

Forget about `F3`, chunk grid, and hitboxes. We're bringing back that magic of first entering the game: when you navigate by stars, landscape, and man-made trails.

:::note Mod Restrictions
Minimaps and Litematica work with restrictions, maintaining a fair challenge.
:::

**Explore the world through the eyes of a pioneer, not a topographer.**

### Living Economy and Resource Value

We've cut drops from natural spawn farms:
- Creepers
- Endermen
- Iron golems

**Result:** every ingot and every stack of gunpowder has weight.

:::tip How to Get Resources
- Develop manual farms
- Use spawners
- Trade with other players

Resources will become valuable again, not junk in chests.
:::

### Hardcore Villager Trading

Villages matter again! We use a biome enchantment system: to collect a top set, you'll have to cross the entire world.

**Features:**
- Forget about level V books from one villager
- Combine resources
- Use diamonds to buy equipment

### Nether as Art, Not a Highway

:::warning Nether Roof is Closed
We're returning you inside the Nether, so that every hub is part of the distorted biome's decorations, not a boring corridor on bedrock.

## 🏮 Your Play Style

### Challenge

Test what you're worth without technical crutches and knowledge of spawn mechanics. Become a legend in a world where everything is earned through labor.

### Leisurely

Just live at your own pace:
- Build a cozy treehouse
- Go fishing
- Contemplate

No one is pushing you into an endless arms race here.
