## ✨ Server Features

Overnight server has improvements in the form of plugins and datapacks. Some are made to improve user experience, others — to expand the creative toolkit.

### Datapacks

#### Geophilic

Probably the most fundamental datapack of the server. Its function is to slightly modify vanilla world generation to "refresh" it. Playing with it, you'll notice all the same familiar landscapes, but in a more perfected form.

## 🔄 End Reset

A server feature — resetting the outer part of the End without affecting the main island.

**Why this is needed:**
- Eliminate elytra shortage
- Not expand the world to excessively large values

When the End resets, its seed and elytra "generation" changes. This opens up space for collecting and adds value to elytras found in earlier End versions.

:::info
Elytra generation is written in the item description (Lore).
